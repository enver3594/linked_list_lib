About This Project
I recently wrote code implementing various functions for working with linked lists. I decided to take it further and create a proper library out of it. This is my first mini-project, serving as a good practice exercise in software development, library design, and version control.

Project Overview
This is a simple C library for working with singly linked lists. It provides basic operations for creating, manipulating, and managing linked lists with clean, well-documented code.
